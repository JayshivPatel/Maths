Prop (1.2) If $f, g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are [[(2) Continuous]] at $a \in \mathbb{R}$ then so are $f . g, f + g, f - g \ and  \ \frac {f}{g}\  with \ g(a) \ne 0$

Prop (1.3) if $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is [[(2) Continuous]] at a and $g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is [[(2) Continuous]] at $f(a)$ then $g(f(x))$ is [[(2) Continuous]] at a

Any $f(x) = x^n$ is [[(2) Continuous]]
Any polynomial is [[(2) Continuous]]
Any rational function (of polynomials) is [[(2) Continuous]]
Any trig function is [[(2) Continuous]]
