For some n x n matrix A, $\lambda$ is an ==eigenvalue== if:

$\exists v \in \mathbb{R}^n s.t \ Av = \lambda v$

(v is known as the ==eigenvector==)

aka if $\lambda$ satisfies $(A - \lambda I_n)v = 0$

This property can relate to other ideas with:
(Prop 4) $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue if: $(A - \lambda I_n)v$ is not invertible
