For some $a_n > 0 \ \forall n$ (which implies that the $s_n$ are monotonically increasing)we have:

- $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty {a_n}$ [[(2) Converges]] $\iff (s_n)$ is bounded above
- $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty {a_n}$ diverges to $+\infty$
	(i.e .$\forall M > 0 \  \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \ such \ that \ s_n > M  \ \forall n \ge N) \iff (s_n)$ is unbounded
