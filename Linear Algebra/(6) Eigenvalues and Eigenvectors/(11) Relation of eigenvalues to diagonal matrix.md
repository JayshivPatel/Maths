Take some A with ==eigenvectors== {$v_1...v_n$} and [[(6) Eigenvalue]]s {$\lambda_1...\lambda_n$} then we can let P = ($v_1 | ... | v_n$) and if P is ==invertible== then A is [[(10) Diagonalisable]] with the corresponding [[(1) Diagonal Matrix]] to be:

$D = P^{-1}AP = diag(\lambda_1....\lambda_n)$ (where "diag" means that the eigenvalues are along the leading diagonal)
