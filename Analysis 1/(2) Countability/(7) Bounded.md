- Maximums are unique
- A set $\emptyset \ne S \subset \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above $\iff$ $\exists M \in \mathbb{R} \ such \ that  \ \forall x \in S, x \le M$
- With M being the upper bound
- A set $\emptyset \ne S \subset \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below $\iff$ $\exists M \in \mathbb{R} \ such \ that  \ \forall x \in S, x \ge M$
- With M being the lower bound
- A set is bounded $\iff$ it is bounded above and below
