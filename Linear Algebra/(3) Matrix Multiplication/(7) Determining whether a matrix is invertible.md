If $\exists v \ne 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n \ such \ that Av = 0$ A is not invertible

If $\exists$ an n x n non-zero matrix B such that AB = 0 or BA = 0 then A is not invertible

If A has a column/row of zeros then A is not invertible

If A' is obtained from A by a row operation then A' is invertible iff A is

If A in [[(4) Row Reduced Echelon Form]]  is the matrix A' then  A' is invertible iff it has no zero rows (of the form of $I_n$)
