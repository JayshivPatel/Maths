We can use congruence as an equivalence relation on the integers where:
$[a] = \{b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \equiv a \ mod \ n \}$

The classes have the following properties:

(Lem 1): (suppose we have that [a] = [a'] and [b] = [b'])
	[a+b] = [a' + b']
	[ab] = [a'b']

(Prop 9): $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is an [[(8) Abelian]] [[(6) Group]]

(Lem 2): for each [a] in Zn, there is a [b] in Zn such that [a]\[b] = 1 $\iff$  a is ==coprime== to n

(Def 11): By restricting to this, we can define 
$\mathbb{Z}^* =$ {$[a] \in \mathbb{Z}^n | \exists [b] \in \mathbb{Z}^n such \ that \ [a][b] = [1]$}

(Prop 10): ($\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ , . ) is an [[(8) Abelian]] over multiplication
