A[[(9) Permutation]] is a ==cycle== if there is a sequence of distinct numbers such that

$\sigma(a_1) = a_2, ...... \sigma(a_k) = a_1$ and $\sigma(i) = i$ for all other numbers not in the sequence.

k is the ==length== of the cycle and the ==order== 

The following properties hold
(Lem 8)
- there is a +ve integer d such that $\sigma^d(i) = i$ for all i
- if d is the smalles +ve integer such that $\sigma^d(i) = i$ then all the $\sigma(i) ...\sigma^{d-1}(i)$ are distinct
- if j is not in the set {$i, \sigma(i), ...\sigma^{d-1}(i)$} then neither is $\sigma(j)$
